Redux:
Everything is saved as a javascript object.

State is the minimal representation of the data in your app.
State tree cannot be modified or wrote too - need to dispatch an action to change it.
	Action is a plain JS object describing the change.
	Action is the minimal representation to the change to that data.
	Structure is up to you, only required to have a {type:'whatever'} property.

Components just need to dispatch an action - they dont have to be concerned with implementation.


Pure function:
  Return value depends souley on the values of their arguments
  No network or database calls
  They just calculate a new value
  They do not modify the values passed to them - don't overrride what you pass into it.
    Return a new object/array/whatever based on the old items


Impure function overrwrite the values you pass to them.
This is bad - redux must work w pure function

UI or view layer is most predictable when its described as a pure function of the applications state
State mutations need to be described as a pure function that takes the prevous state, the action being dispatched, and returns the next state of your application.

Actions are called:: Reducer functions
  They take in state and action, and return a new state.
